### Local Development

2. Open `index.html` in your web browser
3. Navigate through the pages using the navigation menu

### Deployment

#### GitHub Pages
1. Create a new repository on GitHub
2. Upload all files to the repository
3. Go to Settings > Pages
4. Select main branch as source
5. Your site will be live at `https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name`

#### Netlify
1. Drag and drop the folder to Netlify
2. Your site will be deployed instantly

#### Custom Domain
1. Upload all files to your web hosting via FTP
2. Point your domain to the hosting server
3. Ensure `index.html` is in the root directory

## ✏️ Customization

### Update Personal Information

1. **Contact Details**: Edit email, phone, and LinkedIn in all HTML files
2. **About Content**: Modify `about.html` with your information
3. **Projects**: Update `projects.html` with your projects
4. **Skills**: Customize `skills.html` with your skills and proficiency levels
5. **Resume**: Add your resume PDF file (see below)

### Add Your Resume

The portfolio includes a "Download CV" button on the home page and in the footer of all pages.

**To add your resume:**

1. Create or export your resume as a PDF file
2. Rename it to `resume.pdf`
3. Place it in the root directory of the portfolio (same folder as `index.html`)
4. The download buttons will automatically work

**Note**: If you don't have a resume PDF ready, you can temporarily disable the download buttons by removing or commenting out the button code in the HTML files, or the buttons will show a 404 error until you add the resume.pdf file.

### Color Scheme

Edit CSS variables in `style.css`:

```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #00f0ff;      /* Main accent color */
    --bg-dark: #0a0e27;            /* Background color */
    --text-primary: #e8edf5;       /* Main text color */
}
```

### Add More Pages

2. Update the content
3. Add a link to the navigation menu in all files

The contact form currently shows a success message without actual submission. To make it functional:

3. Options include:
   - **Formspree**: https://formspree.io/
